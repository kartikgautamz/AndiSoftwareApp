1. **Vertical Specialization**: Tailored solutions for 10 core industries
2. **Regulatory Alignment**: Pre-configured compliance frameworks
3. **Domain-Specific AI**: Industry-trained machine learning models
4. **Interoperability**: Cross-sector data exchange protocols

### Technical Philosophy
The application embodies three fundamental architectural principles:

1. **Modular Sector Abstraction**:
   - Isolated business domains as independent Swift modules
   - Shared core infrastructure with sector-specific extensions
   - Plugin architecture for new vertical integration

2. **Adaptive Visualization**:
   - Dynamic rendering of complex cloud topologies
   - Context-aware UI theming (healthcare vs manufacturing)
   - Real-time performance telemetry visualization

3. **Compliance-by-Design**:
   - Embedded regulatory checklists (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
   - Automated audit trail generation
   - Security posture scoring system
